                            shows that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same
                            thing. If
                            mass is somehow totally converted into energy, it also shows how much energy would reside
                            inside
                            that mass: quite a lot.

                    ``Imagination is more important than knowledge.
                    Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
                    If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
                    Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
                    Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.
                    Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.
                    In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
                    The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
                    Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
                    Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.``
